Project Name: Console Capsule 

Project Description: Have you ever wanted to figure out which video game came out on the day you were born? Or create a time capsule of classic gaming? While the release dates of classic famous video games are public knowledge, many arcade machines and games made in the 70s and 80s are no longer functioning or rare, and will soon be lost to the effects of time. 

The Capsule Console prevents this problem from further spreading by providing a public and searchable database. Users will be able to type in a year, or a specific date and find out which video games were released or available on that date. The history of video games is a new and growing field. Accurate and up-to-date information must be provided, in order to have a complete picture of popular culture and history. Much like the Ocarina of Time, Capsule Console hopes to take you on a journey of self-discovery by linking you to the past.
 
Installation: Capsule Console does not require any special tools to download locally. Because it uses Javascript and HTML, all that is needed for it to run is an Internet connection. 

Usage: When users visit Capsule Console, they will be directed to the front page and asked to input any year. If the year matches a date a classic video game was released, the user will be directed to a webpage displaying the video game, the year it was released, its genre, and the console on which it can be played. Users also have the ability to find classic video games through special search bars for genre and console, which can be found on the genre and console webpages, respectively. 

Contributing: The developers welcome any and all future contributions to this project. Specifically, contributing authors can add more classic titles and consoles to the list of searchable videogames. They can also add the classic videogame titles to a central text database. In addition to the title, console, genre, and release year, contributing authors can also provide the following information information about classic video games: sales, controviersies, themes, and development. This is not an exclusive list, so any information can be added to the database, as long as it is accurate.
